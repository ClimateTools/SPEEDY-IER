C--
C--:  /LFORCON/: Constants for forcing fields (initial. in INPHYS)
C--:   ALBSN  = Albedo over snow (for snow depth > SDALB)
C--:   SDALB  = Snow depth (mm water) corresponding to maximum albedo
C--:   SWCAP  = Soil wetness at field capacity (volume fraction)
C--:   SWWIL  = Soil wetness at wilting point  (volume fraction)
